My hypothesis would be that a left-leaning red-black tree with randomly generated values would have a 20-25% of red nodes. This is based on the fact that red nodes can only be left children, and that a red node cannot have any red children. This limits the total possible number of red nodes, making it so that the maximum possible number of red nodes is well below half the total nodes. Given the fact that there could be no red nodes at all, my estimation would be that red nodes would make up about 20-25% of the tree.
